    <h2>A lazy/easy way to make really good butter chicken</h2>
    
    <p>This recipe was developed when I was a college student at Purdue University. Over a span of four years, I continuously refined it each time I made it, making adjustments to how I seasoned, how I prepared specific ingredients, and how I cooked specific ingredients, and the order in which they were used.</p>

    <p>Note that the ingredients below do not have quantities listed, as that is how I learned to cook. Don't get caught up in exact volumetric or weighted measurements when you're cooking, unless you're a baker.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>Chicken and marinade:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless, skinless, chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder</li>
        <li>Coriander powder</li>
        <li>Garlic and ginger paste</li>
        <li>Whole fat yogurt</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Kasuri methi</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Gravy</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Red onions</li>
        <li>Unsalted butter</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Kashmiri red chili powder</li>
        <li>Turmeric powder</li>
        <li>Coriander powder</li>
        <li>Garlic and ginger paste</li>
        <li>Garam masala powder</li>
        <li>Heavy cream</li>
        <li>Kasuri methi</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut your chicken into bite sized cubes and throw all of the marinade ingredients into a bowl and mix together until evenly coated.</li>
        <li>Heat a few tablespoons of high heat oil in a wok on high heat over the largest gas burner you have. Just as the oil begins to smoke, add a small portion of your chicken to the wok so that it just covers the bottom. If you're using 8 thighs, try to do this in 4 batches.</li>
        <li>Start stir frying by flipping the chicken in the wok with one hand and stirring with the other hand. After a few minutes, transfer the chicken to a bowl, making sure to take the wok off the direct heat so you don't accidentally burn the leftover oil.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batches of chicken, adding oil as necessary to make sure the chicken doesn't stick.</li>
        <li>Once all of the chicken has been cooked, return the wok to the burner and reduce the heat to medium-high. Add half a stick of butter, let it melt and add your red onions, diced as fine as possible.</li>
        <li>Cook your onions until completely brown and caramelized. This will take a long time, bare minimum of around 20-30 minutes. You can also add your garlic and ginger paste at pretty much any point in this process, just try and make sure that they make direct contact with the hot oil rather than being thrown on top of the onions.</li>
        <li>Add the can of tomato paste and mix it into the onions thoroughly for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to low and add of all the powdered spices. There'll be enough residual heat in the pan to nicely toast the spices. At this point, the oil should have somewhat separated from the onions and tomato paste, so you can toss the spices directly on top and mix together. Cook for about a minute, and add about 2 cups of water.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken back into the wok and stir it into the gravy. Turn the heat back up to medium-high and continue stewing for 5-10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add another half stick of butter and mix until completely melted.</li>
        <li>Add the sugar and garam masala. Stir until homogenous. Taste the gravy, and add more salt if necessary.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat off and dump your bottle of cream in. Mix together until the gravy becomes a nice light orange color.</li>
        <li>Pour some kasuri methi into your hand and rub your hands together over the gravy, letting it crumble into small pieces. Mix together one more time, and transfer to your serving bowl.</li>
        <li>Eat with roti, kulcha, or paratha.</li>
    </ol>
