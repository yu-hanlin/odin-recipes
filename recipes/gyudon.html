        <li>Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Assembly:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>White rice</li>
        <li>Chopped scallions</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook rice in your rice cooker on the quick setting if it has one.</li>
        <li>While the rice is cooking, thinly slice the onion and whatever protein you happen to be using.</li>
        <li>Put a wok or pan on your biggest burner and set the heat to its maximum setting. Wait for about a minute for the pan to heat up and then pour in some oil that should immediately begin to shimmer and smoke. Coat the entire wok with the oil and put in your protein, immediately beginning to vigorously shake and stir fry for about a minute until there is no more pink color.</li>
        <li>Add the onions and continue stirring for another minute. Add all of the sauce components and stir to fully combine. Simmer until the mixture reaches a consistency of your liking.</li>
        <li>Fry an egg to your preference in another pan while the meat mixture is reducing.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is finished cooking, place it into a large bowl and top with the meat mixture. Place the fried egg on top and garnish with the remaining assembly components.</li>
